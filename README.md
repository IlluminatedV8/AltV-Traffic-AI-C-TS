# AltV-Traffic-AI-C-TS
"I just started adding AI traffic to my AltV C# server. Let the chaos begin!"


Here’s the next part of your description translated in a fun, casual style:

"I just dove right into coding, and in my over-engineering frenzy, I messed up. I vaguely remembered seeing a JavaScript version of a traffic AI somewhere and ended up trying to recreate it in JB Rider.

Now, I’ve got this not-so-great-performing AI, but I honestly have no clue how to make it better.

Also, I’d love to have an automated bus line running through Los Santos all day without needing a real player to drive it."

Here’s that part in a playful tone:

"I’d be super happy if someone out there could take pity on me and hook this thing up with a working taxi or bus AI!"


EDIT:


Here's the last part translated in the same style:

"LeonMrBonnie" has a version that doesn’t quite work, but that’s where I got the basic idea from!"
